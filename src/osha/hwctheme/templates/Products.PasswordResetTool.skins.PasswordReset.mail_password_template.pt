We have created a password-protected area in the campaign website where you can find the HWC 2014-15 Campaign material and templates to support you with the campaign implementation.

In this area you will be able to download the available campaign material (more material and related translations will be available at a later date) and the campaign artwork. The website is still under construction and is currently on a test server (a temporary website); therefore the URL to reset your password points there. The site might also be randomly not available as we are working on it.</span><span tal:omit-tag="" tal:condition="is_ocp">
